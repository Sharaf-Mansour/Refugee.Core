[The Standard Systems Design & Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHnjdR9DvGk)

> "The Standard is my interpretation of SOLID principles and many other practices and patterns that continue to enrich our designs and development to achieve truly solid systems. The Standard aims to help every engineer find guidance in their day-to-day work. But more importantly, the Standard can ensure every engineer that when they need to build rugged systems that can land on the moon, solve the most complex problems, and ensure the survival of humankind and its evolution--they have the guidance required."

### Contributing FAQ!

Where to find the list of "Things/Tasks/Issues" you could add to the project ?
- We are using github issues: https://github.com/hassanhabib/Refugee.Core/issues

How to fork and create a branch, properly named ?
- If possible the PR should reflect an open issue's name. **Be careful of case.** All caps for the main category, and capitalized for the title (like a news article title), and separated by colon. Most of the time we want the issue, the commit and the PR to share the exact same name.
- How to fork
  - Look at "How To Contribute to Open Source Community?" video at the 7:30 mark https://youtu.be/mR0N-QxZqYY?t=458
- Branch naming convention:
  - users/[github-username]/[Issue-type/category]-[entity]-[action]
  - Look at this video at the 25:10 mark https://youtu.be/mR0N-QxZqYY?t=1510
- Commit, Issue and PR naming convention:
  - They all should be named similarily to those ones:
    - DATA: Add RefugeeContact Model
    - BROKERS: Insert Refugee
    - CONTROLLER: POST Refugee

How to do a Pull Request the right way ?
- It's better to have only one commit, per initial PR, showing the implementation of one feature. This way people can easily replicate your work, in the future, by looking at all the files you had to change to resolve an issue.

What are the architectural conventions ?
- Please look at [The Standard Systems Design & Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHnjdR9DvGk)
- Please read the [The Standard Book](https://github.com/hassanhabib/The-Standard)

What is the coding style/esthetic we demand ?
- Please read [C# Coding Standard](https://github.com/hassanhabib/CSharpCodingStandard)
